# FancyWatch
An app to control my fancy watch
Has like 90% of the features, if you want to send a custom command you can just head on over to "System" and type in your command.
When running the app, first thing you do is click on your Bluetooth device and wait for it to connect, then you can click on the "Lights" tab, and then the "System" tab, if you do not do stuff in that order then bad stuff will happen.

The apk is in FancyWatch\app\build\outputs\apk\debug
